#
# A domain-free discipline test: it lints the Architecture Decision Records
# against the conventions in template.md and README.md, so the ADR log cannot
# quietly drift. It reads only Markdown, so it needs no toolchain and can be the
# project's first test — before any product code exists. It runs in the
# pre-commit hook and in CI (see docs/ci/), and is the reference the
# "Testing" gate step points to.
#
# Usage:  sh docs/adr/adr-lint.sh [ADR_DIR]
#   ADR_DIR defaults to this script's own directory.
#
# Exit status: 0 = clean, 1 = one or more violations. A missing inbound
# cross-link is a non-fatal WARNing (a brand-new ADR may not be linked yet).
#
# An inbound cross-link is a LINK whose destination names the record's file, from
# a Markdown file outside this directory. A document that only NAMES a record —
# the `ADR-NNNN` shorthand, or its filename in a citation or an example — is
# discussing it, not linking it, and does not satisfy the check.
#
# How to adapt: the checks below mirror docs/adr/template.md and README.md. If
# you change the template — add a required section, change the Status vocabulary
# — change the matching check here in the SAME change. The linter and the
# template must always agree; that is the whole point of it.

# links_to_record NEEDLE FILE... — does any FILE carry a Markdown link whose
# DESTINATION names NEEDLE (a record's filename)? The three destination forms are
# link-lint.sh's, read the same way: inline `](dest)`, a reference definition
# `[label]: dest`, and a raw `href="dest"`. A fenced block and an HTML comment
# are skipped whole and an inline code span is stripped from the line, so a
# link-SHAPED example is not a link.
#
# It matches link syntax; it does not RESOLVE it. Whether the destination lands
# on a real file is link-lint's single job, and the two compose: this
# proves a link to the record exists, that one proves it points at something.
#
# TEN LIMITS, stated rather than left to be found. This is the full list; the
# README states only the one an adopter has to know. Limits 1 to 7 and 10 are
# about what the MATCHING reads; 8 and 9 are about the SHAPE of the tree.
#
#   1. The two checks compose only for an IN-TREE target. link-lint skips http,
#      https and mailto by design, because resolving them needs the network, so a
#      record whose only inbound link is an absolute forge URL reads as
#      cross-linked here and is resolved by nothing -- that URL can name a file
#      that does not exist and both checks stay green. This is the one that is
#      not contrived, and the one the README carries.
#   2. A link to a DIFFERENT file that happens to share the record's filename
#      counts. Resolving the path would answer it, and resolving is link-lint's
#      job, not this one.
#   3. A reference DEFINITION nothing uses counts, although it renders as
#      nothing at all. link-lint's L6 catches only the reverse case.
#   4. A link-shaped example in a FOUR-SPACE indented code block counts. Only
#      fences, HTML comments and inline code spans are excluded. Skipping every
#      indented line would drop real links from list continuations, which is the
#      more expensive error; link-lint reads indented blocks the same way.
#   5. A real link is MISSED on a line that also opens an HTML comment, even one
#      that closes on the same line, because the whole line is skipped. This
#      fails loud -- a spurious warning, not a silent pass -- and link-lint.sh
#      carries the identical construct.
#   6. Stripping code spans REWRITES the line before any destination is read,
#      which cuts both ways: `[x]`foo`(../adr/0001-x.md)` is not a link and is
#      counted as one, and a line carrying an odd backtick -- an apostrophe
#      written as one, say -- can have a real link eaten and the record reported
#      an orphan. link-lint strips the same way.
#   7. Filenames are compared with ==, so on a case-insensitive filesystem a
#      link written [x](0001-Thing.md) resolves for link-lint and does not count
#      here. Loud, and the mirror of link-lint limit 3.
#   8. A SECOND COPY of the ADR directory anywhere under the documents root --
#      a worktree, a vendored submodule, a build cache -- is not excluded: the
#      exclusion is one literal path prefix. Its index README then links every
#      record, and every record reads as cross-linked. This one is SILENT, which
#      makes it the worst of the ten. An adopter who puts the per-task worktree
#      directory under docs/ walks straight into it.
#   9. The ADR directory is assumed to sit DIRECTLY under the documents root:
#      the search space is its parent, and the extra file read is that parent
#      directory of THAT. Move it to docs/architecture/adr/ and the space
#      narrows to docs/architecture/, so every record warns. Loud, and no
#      adopter has to keep the layout -- but nothing tells them, so it is here.
#  10. A destination containing a SPACE names the record only where CommonMark
#      reads a link: the angle form `<dir with space/0001-x.md>`, read to its
#      closing `>` since #78; and the raw HTML form, whose quoted value was
#      always captured whole. A bare destination holding a space names no
#      record, with or without a title: measured, `[x](adr/dir with
#      space/0001-x.md "t")` is NOT counted, because the destination is cut at
#      its first blank before any comparison. Before #78 the `](` and definition
#      branches cut the angle form at the first blank and the record drew a
#      false orphan WARN; measured on five
#      ADR trees identical but for the link form, and re-measured after. A bare
#      destination followed by anything else -- `[x](adr/0001-x.md junk)` -- is
#      not a link on the forge; here it names nothing, where before it counted.
#      (link-lint no longer diagnoses this case: its shrink dropped that handling,
#      and it now reads the path before the first blank.)
#      A `%20` is NOT decoded here, deliberately: names() compares BASENAMES,
#      and the filename check below forbids a space in a record's name, so an
#      encoded space can only sit in the directory part the comparison drops.
#      Measured: `[x](dir%20with%20space/0001-x.md)` counted before #78 and
#      counts after. link-lint no longer decodes `%20` either -- its shrink
#      dropped the spelling-variant handling -- so the former asymmetry between
#      the two extractors is gone. An angle destination holding a `)` is cut at
#      that `)` in both scripts. link-lint still strips a plain `<target.md>`
#      wrapper and resolves it; only the spaced/escaped/`%20` angle variants were
#      dropped in its shrink.
#
# Limits 4, 5 and 6 hold for link-lint too: it is the same reading of the same
# forms. The sharing is BY HAND, though, not by construction -- the fence and
# indent tests are unrolled here for the awks that lack interval expressions
# while link-lint still writes {0,3}, so on such an awk the two disagree about an
# indented fence. If one is fixed, fix both (links/README.md limit 6).
#
# COST: one pass over the search space per record, so O(records x files). The
# search space itself is built once. Measured on a 10,000-file tree with 40
# records it is about 18 seconds -- past the ten that gate step 4 says must show
# progress, and the pre-commit hook shows none. The kit's own tree runs in under
# a second, and the honest shape of the fix is one pass collecting every linked
# filename, not a faster loop.
#
# The fence and indent tests are spelled out rather than written `{0,3}`, for the
# awks with no interval expressions — the same reason anchors_of() in
# link-lint.sh unrolls its own. A fence test that silently never matched would
# read a fenced example as a link, which is the defect this function exists to
# remove.

	#    `set -- $(find ...)` word-splits it, and -- because IFS does not
	#    disable pathname expansion and this script never sets -f -- also GLOBS
	#    it: a linking file named [a-z].md vanished from the list, and a sibling
	#    directory named ad[r] could expand back into the very ADR directory
	#    excluded below. Passing the list as ARGUMENTS also broke on a large
	#    tree, a regression against the grep -R this replaced: past ARG_MAX awk
	#    never ran and every record read as an orphan.
	# 2. Both operator paths reach awk through the ENVIRONMENT, never `-v`.
	#    `awk -v x=VALUE` runs ESCAPE PROCESSING on the value, so a checkout

	#    SILENCED a genuine orphan in one tree and reported every record as an
	#    orphan in another.
	# 3. The fixture patterns are measured on `rel`, the path RELATIVE to the
	#    documents root -- never the absolute path, which carries the operator
	#    directory names. A checkout in a directory called good/ or bad-anything/
	#    otherwise deleted the whole tree from the search space.

# word per space: at a checkout under `…/sp ace/` the run reported
# `FAIL duplicate ADR number: sp` and 89 more, on a repository that violates
# nothing, and a two-space prefix such as `…/a b c/` gave 138. Both measured
# against the pre-fix script; a draft here paired the one-space EXAMPLE with the
# two-space COUNT, which read as consistent because the first clause was right.
# The exposed invocations were the ones the gate itself uses -- the
# no-argument default is $script_dir, absolute by construction at the head of
# this file -- so the pre-commit hook and every CI job met it on every run.
#
# Positional parameters are the POSIX way to carry a list of paths. They need no
# separator, so they close the whole class rather than the reported symptom:
# a space, a tab, a newline and a glob character are all safe. The alternative
# considered and rejected was a newline-joined string with IFS, which fixes the
