# review-record-lint.sh — enforce the review record and its chronology.
#
# A domain-free discipline test, the CI twin of engineering-discipline.md's
# "What a round records" (the review record) and docs/issue-workflow.md (R12, the
# plan and its one review). It reads an
# issue's comments as text and passes only when the record a task leaves behind
# can be parsed and its chronology holds.
#
# Like pr-link-lint.sh and unlike the other linters, it has no repo files to
# lint: issue comments are a forge artifact. So this runs in CI (docs/ci/) and
# NOT in the pre-commit hook, and the forge call lives in the workflow while the
# parsing lives here — which is what makes it testable offline.
#
# Usage:
#   sh docs/ci/review-record-lint.sh [COMMENTS_FILE]
#     COMMENTS_FILE  a file holding the comment stream (used by the self-tests).
#                    With no argument the stream is read from stdin, e.g. in CI:
#                      gh api ... | sh docs/ci/review-record-lint.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 = the record parses and its chronology holds, 1 = it does not.
#
# INPUT CONTRACT. engineering-discipline.md's "What a round records" fixes the
# record's field names and leaves the exact syntax to this check — and this is it.
# The stream is the issue's comments oldest-first, each introduced by a
# separator line:
#
#   === comment created=<ISO-8601> updated=<ISO-8601> ===
#   <the comment body, any number of lines>
#
# A FIELD may be written either way, because both are in use and neither is
# wrong: as a table row `| Commit reviewed | <value> |`, or as a section heading
# `### Commit reviewed` with the value on the next non-blank line. The name may
# carry Markdown emphasis — `Cycle`, **Cycle** and Cycle are the same field.
#
# A VALUE is read out of its cell rather than required to be the whole cell. Real
# records write "`0` — `1750556` is this branch's first frozen head", and the
# datum is the `0`. So the SHA, the cycle number and the verdict are each FOUND
# in the value, not matched against it. This is deliberate: a check that forced
# reviewers to strip their own context would be answered by stripping the
# context, not by writing better records.
#
# The timestamps are compared as strings, which is why ISO-8601 in one timezone
# is required: it sorts lexically. The workflow that feeds this is responsible
# for emitting UTC.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS.
#   RR1  a plan comment exists                      — R12
#   RR2  a plan-review confirmation exists, carrying `Verdict`, `Budget maximum`
#        and `Cycle cap`                             — R12; What a round records
#   RR3  at least one review record exists           — What a round records
#   RR4  every record carries the reviewer's nine fields
#   RR5  `Commit reviewed` is a hexadecimal SHA, 7 to 40 characters
#   RR6  `Cycle` is a non-negative integer
#   RR7  round numbers run 1..n with no gap; `Cycle` values run 0..k with no gap;
#        and k does not exceed the declared cap
#   RR8  the verdict vocabulary is closed and position-correct: an intermediate
#        round is `material`; the last round is `nothing material in scope` or
#        `not mergeable, findings recorded`
#   RR9  chronology: the plan precedes its review, the review precedes round 1,
#        and the rounds are in ascending order of round number
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT ASSERT, and cannot. That the reviewer did not read a barred
# comment. That the model named is the model used. That a round which ran was
# posted at all — a round that ran and was not posted leaves no trace here. It
# makes the record parseable and its chronology checkable; it claims nothing
# more, which is what "What a round records" says of the record itself.
#
# An edited comment (updated later than created) is REPORTED, not failed: a later
# change to a review comment should be posted as a NEW comment, not an edit, so an
# edit is worth a reader's eye but is not by itself a broken record.
#
# `Fixes` is the author's field and lands as a reply after the round, so RR4 does
# not require it: "What a round records" says a record with no `Fixes` is complete
# until the fixes land.
#
# How to adapt: the field names, the verdict values and the heading come from
# engineering-discipline.md's "What a round records". If you change that section,
# change this script in the SAME change — the record and its parser must always agree.
