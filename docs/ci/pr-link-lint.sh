# pr-link-lint.sh — enforce R1: a pull request must link its issue.
#
# A domain-free discipline test, the CI twin of docs/issue-workflow.md (R1) and
# docs/templates/*/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md. It reads a PR/MR body and passes
# only when the body links an issue with a forge keyword and a concrete numeric
# reference. It reads only text, so it needs no toolchain.
#
# Unlike adr-lint.sh / prd-lint.sh, this check has no repo files to lint: the PR
# body is a forge artifact that exists only on a pull-request / merge-request
# event, so this runs in CI (docs/ci/) and NOT in the pre-commit hook.
#
# Usage:
#   sh docs/ci/pr-link-lint.sh [BODY_FILE]
#     BODY_FILE  a file holding the PR body (used by the self-tests). With no
#                argument the body is read from stdin, e.g. in CI:
#                  printf '%s' "$PR_BODY" | sh docs/ci/pr-link-lint.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 = a linked issue was found, 1 = none (or a bad argument).
#
# What counts as a link:
#   keyword : Close(s|d) | Fix(es|ed) | Resolve(s|ed) | Ref(s) | Part of
#   ref     : #123  ·  owner/repo#123  ·  a full issue/MR URL ending in /123
# A concrete numeric id is required, so the template's `#N` placeholder and an
# example inside an <!-- HTML comment --> are both rejected. The id must also END
# at a delimiter (whitespace, punctuation, end of line) — `#123abc` or a URL
# ending in `/123abc` is not a reference to issue 123 and fails. Closing vs.
# linking (Closes vs. Refs/Part of) is the author's call per R1 — both satisfy
# the gate.
#
# How to adapt: the keywords mirror the table in docs/issue-workflow.md (R1). If
# you change that table, change this pattern in the SAME change — the linter and
# the workflow doc must always agree.
