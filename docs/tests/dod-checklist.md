# Definition of Done (DoD) test-coverage checklist

A Definition of Done (DoD) item is a claim, and a claim is not done until a test
proves it. This file turns the [test traceability](traceability-template.md)
table into a gate: it checks that every requirement and every DoD item names a
row in that table, so "done" means "proven", not "looked right".

> **How to adapt this file.** The rule and the checklist below are the reusable
> content — keep them. Replace the `‹…›` DoD items in the table with your
> project's real Definition of Done, and add or remove rows to match it. The one
> row **without** `‹…›` markers — semantic agreement — is kit-owned like the rule
> above it: keep it, because it is the item the kit's own linters hand over by
> design. Delete this note once your own items are in.

## In plain terms

> A checked box with no test behind it is a promise, not proof. This file says
> that every item on the Definition of Done, and every requirement, must point
> at a specific test that passed — if it does not, the item is not done, no
> matter how confident anyone feels about it.

## The rule

Every requirement (`REQ`/`NFR`) and every DoD item maps to at least one
[traceability](traceability-template.md) row whose status is `green` or
`frozen`. `planned` and `red` rows show intent, not proof — they do not close
the item. An item with no row at all is not covered, and the change is not
done; see [Testing](../engineering-discipline.md#testing) for the fuller rule
this checklist enforces.

A DoD item does not have to be a requirement itself — it can be a
process rule ("every commit follows the message format") as easily as a
product capability. Either way, the same test applies: name the test, or the
item is unproven.

### The one item a test cannot close: semantic agreement

Every claim a script can settle is settled by a script
([R5](../issue-workflow.md#r5--deterministic-over-llm-based)). One claim resists
it: that a changed sentence still **means** what its source means. A linter can
prove a summary covers every rule, in the right order, with the right anchors, and
a stub of filler words with the right headings would still pass it. Meaning is the
residual.

So semantic agreement is a DoD item whose evidence is a **recorded review round**
rather than an automated test: the clause-by-clause pass described in
[Reviewing for semantic agreement](../engineering-discipline.md#reviewing-for-semantic-agreement),
reviewed by an independent reviewer — a person or a fresh agent session — under
[Who may review](../engineering-discipline.md#who-may-review).

Its traceability row cites that review record: the commit reviewed, the reviewer,
the lens, and the verdict. This is the **only** item the checklist closes on a
review record instead of a test, and it is stated here rather than left implicit,
because an item with no row and no reason is indistinguishable from one that was
forgotten. If a check that can settle part of it is ever written, that part stops
being a review item and becomes a test — the residual only ever shrinks.

## The DoD, mapped to tests

| DoD item | Test level | Traceability row | Done? |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `‹every requirement has a test›` | `‹unit \| integration›` | `‹a REQ/NFR row in the traceability table›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |
| `‹every user-facing path has a test›` | `‹e2e›` | `‹an E2E row per scenario›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |
| `‹a delivered feature is signed off by a person›` | `‹uat›` | `‹a UAT row, human-checked›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |
| `‹a bug fix has a test that fails on the old code›` | `‹unit \| integration›` | `‹a row citing the bug's task ID›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |
| `‹a known pitfall from guardrails.md is defended against›` | `‹unit \| integration \| e2e›` | `‹a row with a Guardrail cell filled in›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |
| Every changed clause of a summary, rule or checklist still means what its source means | review record | `‹the review round citing commit, reviewer, lens and verdict›` | `‹✓ / ✗›` |

## Checklist

Run this at task close, before the change is called done:

- [ ] Every `REQ`/`NFR` this task touches has at least one `green`/`frozen` row
  in the [traceability table](traceability-template.md).
- [ ] Every item on this task's Definition of Done has a covering test, listed
  above or added as a new row.
- [ ] No requirement change left a stale test — a test written against an old
  requirement is updated or replaced, not left passing against a rule that no
  longer holds.
- [ ] The traceability table's ID set matches the requirement set: no `REQ`/`NFR`
  is missing a row, and no row cites an ID that does not exist.
- [ ] Every document this change edited that **summarises** another document — an
  agent entry point, a rule digest, a checklist — had a clause-by-clause
  [semantic-agreement review](../engineering-discipline.md#reviewing-for-semantic-agreement)
  against its source, and the review record is on the issue.
- [ ] That review was **independent**: a fresh context that did not see the
  author's reasoning or an earlier verdict, at the levels
  [Who may review](../engineering-discipline.md#who-may-review) requires for this
  task's risk.
- [ ] No deterministic check that *could* have settled a claim was left to that
  review instead (R5).
- [ ] The budget declared in the plan-review confirmation was **held**, or the
  overrun is reported on the issue and answered there — an operator's approval or
  a child issue, per
  [Reviewing until findings decay](../engineering-discipline.md#reviewing-until-findings-decay).
  A budget that was never declared is the plan review's gap, not this task's.
