# run-discipline-tests.sh — run every discipline linter against its fixtures and
# assert the exit code. This is the discipline-test level applied to the
# discipline tests themselves: the kit's own conventions-enforcers get tested.
#
# Each linter already self-lints the REAL repo green (in the pre-commit hook and
# in CI). This runner does the complementary job — it proves each linter correctly
# REJECTS bad input — by running its good/bad fixtures and checking the outcome:
#
#   a fixture whose name starts with  good…  must exit 0  (accepted)
#   a fixture whose name starts with  bad…   must exit 1  (rejected for a violation)
#
# A bad case must exit exactly 1 — the linters' documented "one or more violations"
# code — not merely non-zero, so a crashed linter (a syntax error, a not-found, a
# bad-argument exit) is caught rather than mistaken for a rejection.
#
# Fixtures come in two shapes, so the runner dispatches per suite:
#   directory — the linter is pointed at a case directory
#   file      — the linter reads a single file argument
# Which suite takes which shape is the dispatch list at the foot of this file.
# That list is deliberately the only place it is written down: naming the suites
# here as well gives a second copy that goes stale the next time one is added.
#
# Coverage floor. A test that never runs proves nothing, so the runner fails if a
# wired suite yields no recognized cases — it requires every present suite to keep
# at least one good AND one bad fixture, and fails if no case runs at all. That
# turns a silently-disabled suite (fixtures emptied, or renamed out of the
# good*/bad* convention) into a red, instead of a green with no coverage. It does
# not police the exact count, so a single fixture renamed out of the convention is
# still skipped silently as long as one good and one bad remain — keep fixture
# names within good*/bad*, and see each suite's README for the cases it expects.
#
# A suite NAMED here whose linter or fixtures are ABSENT is a FAILURE, not a skip:
# the dispatch list is the contract, so a vanished suite turns the gate
# red rather than passing green. An adopter who drops a suite removes its dispatch
# line below to slim the kit. Entries that are neither good* nor bad* — the shared
# prd facts/ dir, a suite README — are skipped silently.
#
# Usage:  sh docs/tests/run-discipline-tests.sh [-v]
#   -v, --verbose  print an "ok" line per passing case; by default only failures
#                  and a one-line summary are shown (quiet enough for the hook).
# Exit status: 0 = every case matched its expected outcome, 1 = one or more did not.
#
# It reads only text and drives the same POSIX-sh linters, so it needs no
# toolchain. It runs in the pre-commit hook and in CI, alongside those linters.

# check_crlf — the fixtures whose Windows line endings ARE the assertion still
# have them, and are still pinned.
#
# Those files are tests only while they keep their returns. The pin was once
# documented in three places and enforced by NOTHING: strip the returns and the
# CRLF cases degrade into duplicates of their `good` twins, every linter still
# exits 0, and this runner still reported `101 passed, 0 failed`. A green with no
# assertion behind it — the exact defect those fixtures exist to close.
#
# TWO SOURCES OF TRUTH, DELIBERATELY, because either alone is silent on a real
# way to lose the endings:
#
#   the case NAME    a directory named `*crlf*` claims to be a CRLF fixture.
#                    Independent of .gitattributes, so it survives the pin being
#                    DELETED. Deriving only from .gitattributes looked cleaner
#                    and was wrong in the way that matters -- delete the line and
#                    the check that would have complained goes with it. Measured:
#                    with only the derived check, dropping a pin and stripping
#                    the files scored a full green -- every case passing, the
#                    stripped fixtures included.
#   the PINS         every path .gitattributes names eol=crlf. Covers what no
#                    naming convention can see, and covers a pin added later on
#                    the day it is written.
#
# The two sets are unioned and each file is reported ONCE, with the cause it
# actually has. Reporting from both checks independently gave an adopter two
# lines per file that contradicted each other: "copy .gitattributes" directly
# above ".gitattributes pins it".
#
# PER FILE, not per directory. Summing across a directory passed as long as ONE
# file kept its returns, so a case could lose them on every file but the first
# and stay green — and in adr-lint/good-crlf the second record is the one that
# reaches the date check's other branch, so half that assertion would go silent.
