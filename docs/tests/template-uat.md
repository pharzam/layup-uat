# User acceptance test (UAT) template

A generic pattern for writing a user-acceptance-test (UAT) scenario — the human
layer that sits on top of the [end-to-end](template-e2e.md) path, described in
[`test-levels.md`](test-levels.md#3-end-to-end-e2e-tests). A UAT scenario checks
that the delivered behaviour is what a real person actually asked for; a human
reads the plain-language steps and signs off, rather than a command asserting a
result.

> **How to adapt this file.** Copy the [skeleton](#fill-in-skeleton) for each
> user-facing scenario that needs a human sign-off, usually the same scenario an
> [E2E test](template-e2e.md) already automates. Replace every `‹…›`
> placeholder. Delete this note from your own copy once the first real scenario
> is in.

## In plain terms

> A user-acceptance scenario is a short story — given this starting point, when a
> person does this, then this should happen — that a real person reads, tries, and
> either accepts or rejects. It proves the system does what was asked, not just
> what the code was told to do.

## The pattern

- **Write it in plain Given/When/Then.** Given the starting state, when the
  user does something, then a visible outcome follows. No code, no
  internal jargon — a stakeholder who has never read the system's code should
  be able to follow every step.
- **It rides the same path an E2E test automates.** A UAT scenario is not a new
  path to invent; it is the same user-facing journey, described in the words a
  person uses instead of the steps a machine runs. See
  [`template-e2e.md`](template-e2e.md).
- **A person signs it off.** The scenario is judged by a human reading the
  outcome, not by an automated assertion. Name who is qualified to sign off —
  usually whoever asked for the behaviour, or a stand-in with the authority to
  accept on their behalf.
- **The acceptance is recorded, not just observed.** Trying the scenario and
  liking the result is not enough — write down who accepted it and when, so the
  sign-off is a fact in the repo, not a memory.

## Fill-in skeleton

```text
Scenario: ‹title›

Given ‹starting state›
When ‹the user does …›
Then ‹the visible outcome›

Accepted by ‹person› on ‹date›
Covers ‹REQ-…›
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Every user-facing scenario that needs sign-off has a UAT written for it.
- [ ] The steps are plain words a stakeholder understands, with no code or
      internal jargon.
- [ ] Acceptance is recorded — a named person and a date — not just observed.
- [ ] Names the requirement it accepts via a
      [traceability](traceability-template.md) row.

A UAT scenario is the project's human acceptance step, not another rung of the
automated ladder in [`test-levels.md`](test-levels.md) — nothing here runs in
the hook or in CI. It confirms, by a person's own judgement, that the path an
[E2E test](template-e2e.md) automates does what was actually asked for.
