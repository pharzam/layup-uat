# Link discipline

The check that keeps the documents' own navigation honest.

| File | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| [`link-lint.sh`](link-lint.sh) | Resolves every in-tree Markdown link and heading anchor. Runs in the [`pre-commit` hook](../../.githooks/pre-commit) and in [CI](../ci/). |
| [`tests/`](tests/) | Its fixtures — one `good` case and a `bad-*` case per assertion, plus one per false-green hole a review found. Run by [`run-discipline-tests.sh`](../tests/run-discipline-tests.sh). |
| [`tests/expect-check.sh`](tests/expect-check.sh) | Asserts each `bad-*` case fails for **its own** assertion, not merely that it fails. |

## Why it exists

Armature's product **is** its documents, and they are a web of relative links and
heading anchors. Rename a heading and every anchor pointing at it dies silently:
the page still renders, the link still looks like a link, and a reader following
it lands nowhere. Nothing in the kit caught that until this check.

The gap was found the honest way. A review
noticed that a "311 links resolve" claim had been cited beside the committed
linters as if it were one of them, when it came from a throwaway script. It was
not repeatable, so it was not evidence —
[R5](../issue-workflow.md#r5--deterministic-over-llm-based) says a mechanizable
claim belongs in a mechanism. This is that mechanism.

On its first run over the tree it found a real dead link in
`docs/ci/tests/pr-link/README.md`, which had pointed one directory too shallow
since the file was written.

## What it asserts

| ID | Assertion |
|----|-----------|
| `L1` | Every relative link target resolves to a path that exists. |
| `L2` | Every `#fragment` on an in-tree `.md` target names a heading in that file. |
| `L3` | Every same-file `#fragment` names a heading in the linking file. |
| `L4` | No link target escapes the repository root. |
| `L5` | Coverage floor — a run that resolved **zero** links fails. |
| `L6` | Every reference use `[text][label]` has a matching `[label]: target` definition. |
| `L7` | No in-tree target is an absolute path. |

It reads **plain in-tree links only**. A destination is read as a bare path: the
CommonMark angle form `[x](<target.md>)` has its wrapper stripped and resolves, but
a destination is otherwise cut at its first blank. A spaced, angle-with-junk or
empty destination is therefore not *diagnosed* — it simply does not resolve as a
link, or fails `L1` if a cut leaves a plain path the tree does not hold. A
template's own navigation does not use those spellings, so the CommonMark
spelling-variant machinery a general checker would need is deliberately not here.

## What it proves, and what it does not

It proves a link's target **exists**. It does **not** prove the link is the
**right** one: a link to the wrong existing file, or to a real heading that does
not say what the sentence claims, passes every assertion here. That is the
[semantic-agreement review](../engineering-discipline.md#reviewing-for-semantic-agreement),
not this script.

## What it skips, and the limits that leaves

- **External `http(s)` links.** Checking them needs the network, which would cost
  the offline property every [discipline test](../tests/test-levels.md#discipline-tests)
  depends on. A rotted external link is not caught here.
- **Placeholders** — `‹…›` adopter markers, `<…>` shapes, and the ADR template's
  `NNNN-…` form. Flagging one would push an author to "fix" a template by
  inventing a filename, which is the placeholder-integrity failure
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) warns about.
- **Fenced code blocks, HTML comments, and inline code spans**, whose links are
  examples, not navigation. A link-shaped example in backticks is not resolved.
- **Fixture case directories** — any path with a `good`, `good-*` or `bad-*` component.
  Their links are deliberately broken: `docs/links/tests/bad-entry-point-dead-link/`
  exists to make `link-lint` reject a dead link, and linting it would report that
  suite's success as failure. **The limit is real and named: a genuinely broken
  link in a fixture's own prose goes unseen.** Fixture *suite* READMEs are not
  skipped — they are prose a reader follows, and that is exactly where the one
  real defect was found.
- **A nested checkout under the root** — a linked worktree, a clone, a submodule.
  The file list is what git lists for this repository, so a copy of the tree
  inside one is never read. Limit 7 below carries the detail.
- **Links into a path containing a space, and other CommonMark spelling variants.**
  A destination is read as a bare path, so a spaced inline link is cut at the first
  blank: `[a](Design Notes/target.md)` is read as a link to `Design` and fails
  `L1`, and the percent-encoded and angle-wrapped spellings of a spaced path are
  likewise not resolved as in-tree links. The plain angle form into a space-free
  path, `[a](<target.md>)`, does resolve — its wrapper is stripped. **The raw HTML
  form is the exception for spaced paths** — `<a href="Design Notes/target.md">` is
  captured between its quotes, spaces and all, and resolves. A template's own
  navigation does not use spaced paths, and the machinery to *diagnose* the spelling
  variants was removed deliberately.

## The forms it reads

A checker blind to a link form is worse than no checker, because the reader
trusts it. Four forms are read:

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| Inline | `[x](target.md)` |
| **Nested** | `[![alt](inner.png)](outer.md)` — both destinations |
| Reference | `[x][label]`, and the **collapsed** `[x][]` whose label is its own text |
| Raw HTML | `<a href="target.md">` |

Nested links are found by scanning for **each `](` opener** rather than matching a
whole `[…](…)`: a whole-link match consumes the inner link and advances past the
outer destination, which is a silent false green on the badge idiom.

The plain CommonMark angle destination `[x](<target.md>)` is a real link: its
wrapper is stripped and the path resolves. An adopter marker only *opens* with `<`,
as in `<id>.md`, and closes it somewhere after — `is_placeholder()` tells the two
apart on that trailing text, so a real angle link is never skipped as a placeholder
and `[detail](<id>.md)` is still skipped as one. Beyond the wrapper strip a
destination is read as a bare path cut at its first blank, so the spaced, escaped
and percent-encoded angle spellings are not resolved as in-tree links — see the
skip list above.

## Why A19 was removed, and what replaced it

`agents-lint` once carried its own assertion **A19**, resolving the root
`AGENTS.md`'s links. It was removed
because this check walks every Markdown file in the tree and `AGENTS.md` is one of
them — the same work, done once instead of twice, across four link forms instead
of one.

One branch of A19 was **not** redundant: it rejected an **absolute** target, and
this check accepted one. That gap is now `L7`, and closing it here covers every
file in the tree rather than the single file A19 watched.

`bad-entry-point-dead-link` is the fixture that keeps the replacement honest. Note
what it does *not* prove: this check is **filename-agnostic**, so it does not know
`AGENTS.md` is special. The case locks the intent, and would go red if a future
change excluded the repository root from the walk.

## Seven limits, recorded rather than hidden

1. **The slug rule is a hand-maintained approximation of GitHub's, with no mechanism
   behind it.** `slug()` began as a copy of `agents-lint`'s A19; that assertion was
   removed and `agents-lint`
   itself has since been removed, so `slug()` is now the rule's only home. It also
   drops underscores, which GitHub keeps in an anchor: harmless while no heading in
   the tree uses one, and a defect the day one does.
2. **Duplicate headings are not disambiguated.** GitHub appends `-1` to the second
   occurrence's slug; `anchors_of()` does not, so a legitimate `#foo-1` link would
   be wrongly rejected. No duplicate heading exists in the tree today. This is a
   false *red* — it fails loudly rather than passing silently, which is the right
   direction for a bug to point.
3. **A case-mismatched target passes on a case-insensitive filesystem.** `[ -e ]`
   on macOS accepts `Target.md` for `target.md`, where Linux CI rejects it, so the
   local hook is more lenient than the authority. CI is the authority precisely
   for this class of difference.
4. **A protocol-relative target `//host/path` is reported as an absolute path.**
   It is really an external link, and `L7`'s message misnames it. Inherited
   unchanged from `agents-lint`'s A19, which matched `/*` the same way, so this is
   a limit carried over rather than introduced — recorded here because it was
   never written down there.
5. **A line beginning `[word]: text` is read as a reference definition.** The
   target is the first blank-delimited word after the colon, so `[TODO]: fixme`
   reports a broken link to `fixme`, and `[TODO]: revisit this later` reports one
   to `revisit` — loud in both cases, and the direction is safe. CommonMark itself
   allows nothing after the destination and its optional title (§4.7, example 209),
   so a line carrying prose after the target is a paragraph on the forge, not the
   definition this reads it as; the label it appears to define therefore counts
   toward `L6` when it should not. No such line exists in the tree.
6. **A second link extractor lives in `adr-lint.sh`.** Its `links_to_record()`
   reads Markdown destinations to decide whether an ADR record has an inbound link; it resolves nothing —
   that stays this linter's job — but the two must broadly agree about what a link
   *is*, and nothing but a hand check keeps them in step. They have diverged before,
   each time found by reading one against the other: this one stripped a CommonMark
   angle wrapper and that one did not,
   and that one stripped a trailing carriage return while this one did not, so every
   reference definition in a CRLF file reported as broken here and resolved there. Both are fixed. The two
   now part on the CommonMark spelling variants this linter dropped (spaced, angle
   and percent-encoded destinations): `links_to_record()` still reads them, because
   it compares **basenames** only and an ADR filename forbids a space, so a spelling
   variant can only touch the directory part it drops — where this linter, reading
   plain in-tree links, does not need it.
7. **The file list comes from git, not a hand-written walk.** This linter lists
   the repository's files as what git tracks plus what it does not ignore, read
   NUL-delimited so no name is quoted and with symlinks refused, so a nested
   checkout is one entry and never read, with a `find` walk that prunes any
   directory holding a `.git` entry whenever this directory is not itself the
   repository root, or git lists nothing. The same shape as limits
   1 and 6, **by hand, with no mechanism**:
   [`nested-checkout-check.sh`](../tests/nested-checkout-check.sh) drives both
   copies but does not compare them. The shape's own limit: `--exclude-standard`
   reads `.git/info/exclude` and the global ignore file, neither versioned, so two
   operators on one commit can get different lists.

## The `EXPECT` convention

Each `bad-*` directory carries an `EXPECT` file holding only its assertion id.
The [discipline-test runner](../tests/run-discipline-tests.sh) compares **exit
codes only**, so a bad case that started failing for a different reason would
still look green there. [`tests/expect-check.sh`](tests/expect-check.sh) closes
that for this suite, and fails if it finds no case to check.

That is the pitfall
[`guardrails.md`](../guardrails.md#gate-pitfalls-kit-wide--keep-these) names — a
harness that compares only exit codes — which is why a close-out that turns on a
specific assertion id pastes this script's output beside the runner's.

It is a script rather than a copy-paste loop, but it is **not yet a gate** — it is
not wired into the runner. Generalizing `EXPECT` across every suite is future
work; this suite is ready for it.

## The cases

| Case | Expected | Exercises |
| ---- | -------- | --------- |
| `good` | `link-lint: OK`, exit 0 | every rule and every form in its passing shape — inline, nested, reference, HTML, angle destination, a fragment, a same-file fragment, a directory, the double-hyphen slug, an external link, both placeholder shapes, and a link-shaped example in a code span |
| `good-crlf` | `link-lint: OK`, exit 0 | the same file with **Windows line endings**. Its three reference definitions — a path, a path with a fragment, and a same-file fragment — each failed `L1`, `L2` and `L3` before the carriage return was stripped; the inline, angle and raw-HTML forms beside them never did, and are there to show where the boundary was. Its endings are pinned by [`.gitattributes`](../../.gitattributes); without that pin, anyone whose git is set to `core.autocrlf=input` or `true` strips the returns the next time they stage it — the conversion happens on the way *into* the blob, not on checkout — and the case then passes while testing nothing. Git normally skips that conversion for a file whose blob already holds returns, but `eol=crlf` keeps these blobs as line feeds on purpose, so that guard does not cover them |
| `bad-dead-path` | FAIL `L1`, exit 1 | a link to a file that does not exist |
| `bad-crlf-expect` | FAIL `L1`, exit 1 | the same, on a case that is **CRLF throughout — its `EXPECT` file included**. That is what gives [`expect-check.sh`](tests/expect-check.sh)'s own carriage-return strip a case: it reads `EXPECT` and demands that id in the linter's output, and before the strip the id was `L1` plus a return, which matches no line — so every case in this suite failed there while the linter beside it was right. The case is *named* `crlf` on purpose, which is what puts it inside the runner's case-name check |
| `bad-dead-fragment` | FAIL `L2`, exit 1 | a real file, an anchor it does not have |
| `bad-same-file-fragment` | FAIL `L3`, exit 1 | a bare `#anchor` this file does not have |
| `bad-escapes-root` | FAIL `L4`, exit 1 | a target that climbs out of the tree |
| `bad-no-links` | FAIL `L5`, exit 1 | a file with nothing left to resolve — the fail-open |
| `bad-reference-target` | FAIL `L1`, exit 1 | a broken destination reached only through a `[label]:` definition |
| `bad-nested-link` | FAIL `L1`, exit 1 | a badge-shaped link whose **outer** target is broken and inner one is not |
| `bad-undefined-label` | FAIL `L6`, exit 1 | a reference label nothing defines |
| `bad-absolute-target` | FAIL `L7`, exit 1 | an absolute target, which resolves for any file at the repository root and so passes silently |
| `bad-entry-point-dead-link` | FAIL `L1`, exit 1 | the **redundancy test** — a dead link in a root `AGENTS.md`, locking the coverage that `agents-lint`'s A19 used to provide |
| `bad-collapsed-reference` | FAIL `L6`, exit 1 | the collapsed `[x][]` form, whose empty second bracket makes a naive reader drop it |

Each `bad-*` case is otherwise valid, so it fails for its own single reason.
