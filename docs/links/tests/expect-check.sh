# expect-check.sh — assert each bad-* case fails for ITS OWN assertion, not merely
# that it fails. The discipline-test runner compares exit codes only, so a fixture
# that started failing for a different reason would still look green there. Each
# `bad-*` directory carries an EXPECT file holding its assertion id; this loop
# reads it and demands that id in the output.
#
# Usage:  sh docs/links/tests/expect-check.sh
# Exit status: 0 = every case failed for its own reason, 1 = one or more did not.
